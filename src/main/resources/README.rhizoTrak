#
# rhizoTrak is a tool for manual and semi-automated annotation of root images.
# It is implemented as plugin for Fiji (https://fiji.sc).
#
# The code of this project is substantially based on the TrakEM2 (https://imagej.net/TrakEM2)
# plugin for ImageJ/Fiji, i.e. it extends TrakEM2's functionality for the specifics
# of root image annotation. For example, rhizoTrak adds support for importing and exporting
# annotation data in RSML format ( https://rootsystemml.github.io/data), extends the
# connector concept from purely geometric to object-based links, and adds several additional
# configuration options.
#
# TrakEM2 as well as rhizoTrak are both released under the General Public License version
