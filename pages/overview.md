<span class="rhizoTrakClass">rhizoTrak</span>  is a free tool for flexible and efficient manual annotation of complex time-series minirhizotron images.     

![minirhizotron sample image](../assets/exampleDataSet1/me_T23_001_25.02.15_000000_1_njo.jpg)

<span class="rhizoTrakClass">rhizoTrak</span>  supports 
- the inherent representation of branching roots by modeling roots as treelines.
- an individual radius for each node of a treeline, and 
	user-definable status labels for segments of treelines 
- a large collection of editing operations for root treelines including split and merge, 
	where many of these operations are easily accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- different visualization options for treelines and fast hiding and un-hiding of all 
	annotated treelines
- import and processing of the complete set of images of a time series
in one single project
-  easy browsing through time points which  enables to annotate roots by simultaneously 
	considering images of different time points. 
- temporal links between roots in different
images which  explicitly represented identity of the same physical root via so-called connectors
- easy transfer of annotation data of one time point to the next
 as initial annotation where
	connectors between corresponding root annotations are automatically established
- automatic checks for inconsistencies in root typology due to merging of treelines
	and assistance in solving them
- redirection of treelines which is important as the upstream and downstream of a root is often not straightforward to be identified in minirhizotron images
-  import
and export of annotations from/to [RSML format](http://rootsystemml.github.io/), 
- export of root measurements in a tab-separated format including the option to aggregate
	measurements within images
