description: sample data of rhizoTrak
---

We supply a data set which is also used for experimental evaluation in the accompanying paper.
It comprises five images from the Jena experiment. For details see the [paper](docs.html).

The data is available in two different variants as rhizoTrak projects
1. one [rhizoTrak project](../assets/exampleDataSet1/rhizoTrak_t23-blank.zip)  with the five images imported

   - download and unzip to a directory of your choide
   - open the project <code>rhizoTrak_t23-blank.xml</code> with rhizoTrak     
      Note: This will also pop-up  a window stating  <code>TrakEM2 detected a crash</code>,
	The reason for this is that cached data are not included in the distributed zip file
	to reduce the amout of data. 
	If you close the project and re-open it this will be corrected.
2. one [rhizoTrak project](../assets/exampleDataSet1/rhizoTrak_t23.zip) with the five images imported and the complete annotations
	as used for evaluation     

   - download and unzip to a directory of your choide
   - open the project <code>rhizoTrak_t23-blank.xml</code> with rhizoTrak.   
	As above, a crash will be reported.
   - annotations were performed without diameter, i.e. root width

In addition the csv files for detailed and aggregated mode are available
   - [detailed](../assets/exampleDataSet1/rhizoTrak_t23-detailed.csv)
   - [aggregated](../assets/exampleDataSet1/rhizoTrak_t23-aggregated.csv)
